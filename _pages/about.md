I am a PhD student in Machine Learning, supervised by [Gabriel Peyré](https://www.gpeyre.com/) and [Pierre Ablin](https://pierreablin.com/) at [Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/), Paris.

I investigate theoretical and practical properties of Transformers.

News
======
- **January 2025:** Our new preprint [A Unified Perspective on the Dynamics of Deep Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18322) is out! Joint work with [J. A. Carrillo](https://carrilloja.org/), G. Peyré, P. Ablin. With a PDE formalism, we investigate the dynamics of tokens as they go through an infinitely deep Transformer.
- **January 2025:** I presented our paper [How Smooth Is Attention?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14820) at the [MLSP Seminar](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE/seminars/machine-learning-and-signal-processing/machine-learning-and-signal-processing?set_language=fr&cl=fr), ENS de Lyon
- **September 2024:** I officially started my PhD!
- **June 2024:** I presented a poster at the CIRM research school [Frontiers in Interacting Particle Systems](https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/3050.html). Joint work with [J. A. Carrillo](https://carrilloja.org/)
- **April 2024:** Our paper [How Smooth Is Attention?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14820) was accepted at ICML 2024! We investigate the (local) Lipschitz constant of self-attention, and show that it grows with the sequence length.
- **October 2023:** I am starting a 3-month visit at [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), to work with [José Antonio Carrillo](https://carrilloja.org/).
- **April 2023:** I started my master thesis at ENS PSL with Gabriel Peyré and Pierre Ablin!

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
